					<p class='jordanName'>Air Jordan I</p>
					<p class='jordanInfo'>Both Michael Jordan and his first Air Jordan shoe burst onto the NBA scene in flashy fashion in 1985. Jordan was named <a href=http://www.nba.com/history/awards/rookie-of-the-year target=_blank>Rookie of the Year</a>. And the Air Jordan I was <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_762358797&feature=iv&src_vid=hj-sssMEo58&v=O8EtsIzSCPk target=_blank>banned by the NBA</a>, at least according to Nike lore. In reality, NBA commissioner David Stern banned a similar black and red shoe that predated the AJ I for violating the league’s uniform policy. But Nike’s marketing story stuck: the shoe’s were banned and Jordan was charged a <a href=https://www.complex.com/sneakers/2018/04/the-history-of-michael-jordans-banned-sneakers/banned-from-the-nba target=_blank>$5000 fee</a> (which Nike covered) each time he wore them on the court. This tale of defiance and <a href=https://www.jordan.com/collection/air-jordan-1 target=_blank>“brazen charisma”</a> came to define the Air Jordan brand for decades to come.</p>

The sneakers were <a href=https://www.jordan.com/collection/air-jordan-2 target=_blank>made in Italy</a> with faux lizard skin and ditched the iconic Nike swoosh. Nike’s accompanying <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfVs32nEYTk target=_blank>1986 commercial</a> featured MJ effortlessly walking through the air and throwing down his signature “Rock-a-bye Baby” dunk.</p>

					<p class='jordanInfo'>MJ dominated the 1988 NBA season all while wearing the Air Jordan IIIs. He was named both league <a href=http://www.espn.com/nba/history/awards/_/year/1988 target=_blank>MVP and Defensive Player of the Year</a> and soared to his second dunk contest title. With this win, <a href=https://www.jordan.com/collection/air-jordan-3 target=_blank>“came an inspiring and memorable image of flight,”</a> and the Jumpman logo was born. The AJ III was designed by Tinker Hatfield, who would go on to become the most prolific Air Jordan designer and the force behind 21 of the 32 sneakers in the franchise. AJ III’s <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acPsvaRfWBg target=_blank>comedic commercial</a> featured Jordan alongside (or rather, under) Spike Lee’s <a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091939/ target=_blank><i>She’s Gotta Have It</i></a> Mars Blackmon character.</p>

The <a href=https://www.jordan.com/collection/air-jordan-6 target=_blank>silhouette of the shoe</a> was inspired by MJ’s German sportscar, and designer Tinker Hatfield included many <a href=https://www.sneakerfiles.com/air-jordans/jordan-6/ target=_blank>firsts and personal touches</a>: it was the first basketball shoe to have a reinforced toe, the first in the franchise to include a loop or “spoiler” on the back of the shoe to help the wearer get them on and off, and if you look closely MJ’s number 23 can be seen in the shoe’s side shapes.</p>

The original sneakers featured MJ’s number 23, but a special Olympic colorway was released with his Team USA number 9. All the designs for the AJ VII were <a href=https://www.sneakerfiles.com/air-jordans/jordan-7/ target=_blank>inspired by African Tribal prints.</a> The AJ VII also marked a visible split from Nike branding and a blossoming pairing with Bugs Bunny. The <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuAIikQMBdk target=_blank>commercial</a> featured Bugs as “Hare Jordan” alongside the original “Air Jordan.”</p>

Although Jordan took a hiatus from basketball, his brand was still turning out coveted kicks.

The AJ IX has a <a href=https://www.sneakerfiles.com/air-jordans/jordan-9/ target=_blank>“rising sun” on the back</a> with the Jumpman logo and features <a href=https://www.jordan.com/collection/air-jordan-9 target=_blank>multilingual translations</a> of Jordan’s attributes like independence, freedom, athletic, and force on the sole.</p>

					<p class='jordanInfo'>Jordan traded in his sneakers for basketball cleats and had a brief stint as a <a href=https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls-white-sox-michael-jordan-signed-minor-league-deal-23-years-ago-today target=_blank>minor league baseball player</a>. Nike and long-time designer Tinker Hatfield thought it was the end of Jordan’s basketball career, so they designed with that in mind. The AJ X sole features <a href=https://www.sneakerfiles.com/air-jordans/jordan-10/ target=_blank>a list of MJ’s accomplishments</a> from each of his season’s in the NBA. But Jordan was far from done, and on March 18, 1995 he sent the Chicago Bulls a fax with two words: <a href=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/ct-archive-michael-jordan-im-back-bulls-20160318-story.html target=_blank>“I’m back.”</a> In his first game back, MJ, wearing the AJ X and the number 45, dropped 55 points on the New York Knicks in the now infamous <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh84pdb_chU target=_blank>“double nickel” game.</a> The official commercial for the AJ X even poked fun at Jordan’s career switch suggest that is was <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49yRlYxMI_k target=_blank>all a dream.</a></p>

He drew his inspiration from a <a href =https://www.sneakerfiles.com/air-jordans/jordan-11/ target=_blank>shiny convertible body</a> and created the base of the shoe out of patent leather. Jordan reunited with old pal Bugs Bunny for the <a href=https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm target=_blank><i>Space Jam</i></a> movie, and the AJ XI were featured in a scene that <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK-IkAUl4rQ target=_blank>pans upward from MJ’s sneakers</a> to his face.</p>

And both the shoe and the legend were in fine form for the 1996-97 NBA season. MJ recorded 38 points in the legendary <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NXUsH-_1Jc target=_blank>“Flu Game,”</a> where he battled a 103-degree temperature and still bested the Utah Jazz in Game 5 of the Finals, on his way to his fifth ring. Designer Tinker Hatfield borrowed from <a href=https://www.sneakerfiles.com/air-jordans/jordan-12/ target=_blank>the Japanese Nisshoki shoe and Rising Sun flag</a> (the side stitching resembles sun rays). Like many Air Jordan models before it, the AJ XII featured Jordan’s number 23, but this time it was on the tongue and written as “Two 3.”</p>

This was the last model MJ wore as a Chicago Bull. Like many other shoes in the Air Jordan franchise, the AJ XIV take inspiration from Jordan’s fast cars, this time his Ferrari 550 M (the Jumpman logo is placed in a <a href=https://www.sneakerfiles.com/air-jordans/jordan-14/ target=_blank>Ferrari-like crest</a> on the side of the sneaker). Each sneaker also squeezes in a <a href=https://www.sneakerfiles.com/air-jordans/jordan-14/ target=_blank>total of seven Jumpman logos</a>, making the pair add up to 14.</p>
